# **Assessing Consistency and Transparency in MotoGP Steward Decisions**
# **An Analysis of 2022 Rulings and Stakeholder Sentiment**

# _**Project Overview**_

This project critically examines the consistency, transparency, and stakeholder sentiment surrounding the MotoGP Stewards Panelâ€™s decisions during the 2022 season. It analyzes how these decisions impacted the MotoGP, Moto2, and Moto3 classes, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative approaches, including sentiment analysis from Instagram, to evaluate the fairness of the Stewards' decisions.

# _**Project Objectives**_

The main objectives of the project are to:

_Identify contentious decisions that sparked debate among stakeholders._

_Analyze the consistency of sanctions for similar infractions across different classes._

_Evaluate stakeholder sentiment through Instagram, focusing on riders, teams, media, and fans._

_Provide recommendations to improve the transparency, consistency, and fairness of the Stewards Panel's decisions._

# _**Methodology**_

The project uses a mixed-methods approach:

**Descriptive Analytics**: To identify key trends and patterns in rule enforcement and penalty issuance.

**Diagnostic Analytics**: To explore the underlying causes of inconsistencies in penalty decisions.

**Sentiment Analysis**: Using tools like BERT, Instagram comments were analyzed to gauge public sentiment on key decisions.

**Data Sources**: The analysis used the official MotoGP Stewards decision dataset and Instagram data for sentiment evaluation.

# _**Key Findings**_

**Irresponsible Riding**accounted for over two-thirds of all infractions, with "Long Lap Penalties" being the most common sanction.

There were **inconsistencies** in how penalties were applied across different circuits and classes, raising concerns about fairness.

**Riders** expressed the most **negative sentiment**, particularly in cases involving severe penalties. Neutral sentiment dominated media and public opinions, but negative reactions were more prevalent for severe sanctions.

# _**Recommendations**_

**Standardize Penalty Guidelines**: Develop clearer, more transparent rules to ensure consistent enforcement across classes and circuits.

**Enhance Rider Education**: Implement training programs, particularly for younger riders in Moto3, to reduce infractions.

**Improve Communication**: Strengthen communication strategies between the Stewards Panel, riders, teams, and the public to clarify the rationale behind penalties.

**Tailor Regulatory Approaches**: Develop class- and circuit-specific regulations to ensure fairness in unique racing contexts.

**Engage with Media**: Work proactively with media outlets to ensure balanced reporting and reduce negative perceptions of penalties.

# _**Technologies Used**_

**Python**: For data processing, sentiment analysis (BERT), and visualization.

**Instagram**: As the primary source for stakeholder sentiment analysis.

**ExportComment**: Used for scraping Instagram comments.

**Excel**: For data management and analysis

# _**Project Files**_

**Final Report (PDF)**: Detailed findings and recommendations for improving MotoGP steward decision-making.

**Python Scripts**: Used for data processing, sentiment analysis, and generating visualizations.

**MotoGP Stewards Decision Dataset**: Detailed information on the 2022 season's disciplinary decisions, including penalties and appeals.

# _**Data Availability**_

Due to confidentiality and privacy concerns, the original dataset used in this analysis cannot be made publicly available. The dataset contains sensitive information, which is protected under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).

If you'd like to replicate the analysis, you can use a similar publicly available dataset or generate synthetic data following the structure outlined in the code. Detailed instructions for replicating the analysis with an alternative dataset are included in the repository.

# _**How to Use This Repository**_

**Download the Python Scripts**: Follow the steps to replicate the sentiment analysis and data processing.

**Consult the Report**: Access the PDF report for a comprehensive breakdown of the analysis and recommendations.

**Examine the Datasets**: Ensure the duplicate relevant datasets are properly placed in relevant folders before running the scripts.
